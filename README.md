# MODELING ABSENTEEISM AT WORK DATASET USING SUPERVISED LEARNING
Machine Learning Models for Absenteeism at Work Dataset

## MACHINE LEARNING 
In basic terms, Machine Learning (ML) is the process of training a piece of software, called a model, to make useful predictions using a data set. This predictive model can then serve up predictions about previously unseen data. We use these predictions to take action in a product; for example, the system predicts that a user will like a certain video, so the system recommends that video to the user.

Often, people talk about ML as having two paradigms, supervised, and unsupervised learning. For this repo, the paradigms of supervised learning use to modeling the Absenteeism at work Kaggle dataset.

### SUPERVISED LEARNING
A supervised learning algorithm takes labeled data and creates a model that can make predictions given new data.

These can be either a classification problem or a regression problem. In a classification problem, there might be test data consisting of photos of animals, each one labeled with its corresponding name. The model would be trained on this test data and then the model would be used to classify unlabeled animal photos with the correct name. In a regression problem, there is a relationship trying to be determined among many different variables. Usually, this takes place in the form of historical data being used to predict future quantities. An example of this would be predicting the future price of a stock based on past prices movements.
